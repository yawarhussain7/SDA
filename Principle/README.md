<p><strong>Problem</strong>
    In a Video Shop Management System, the system should handle customers, video rentals, and video stock. The challenge is to decide which class should be responsible for creating instances of other classes 
    <strong>Solution</strong>
    <li style="disc"> GRASP Creator suggests that a class that contains or closely interacts with another class should create instances of that class.</li>
    <li style="disc">This improves maintainability, reduces code duplication, and follows object-oriented principles.</li>
